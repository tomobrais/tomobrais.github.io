        <li>In 2015, 34.7% of MSW generated in the U.S. was recovered for recycling or composting, diverting 91.2 million tons of material from landfills and incinerators—almost 2.7 times the amount diverted in 1990.</li>
        <li>92% of corrugated boxes were recovered for recycling in 2015; other commonly recycled products include lead-acid batteries (99%), newspapers (71%), major appliances (62%), and aluminum beverage cans (55%).</li>
        <li>Common products with poor recycling rates include: carpet (6%), small appliances (6%), and furniture (0.1%).</li>
        <li>Packaging and containers made up 30% of the MSW generated in 2015.</li>

        for nearly every variety of food or beverage, there’s a coating that’s been devised just for it. Coatings for tomatoes must be stain resistant, those for fish must resist sulfur, and those for fruits and pickles must resist acids. There’s one coating for tomatoes, one for beans, one for potatoes, and another for corn, peas, fish, and shrimp. For beer, engineers might use a coating that contains cyclodextrin, a donut-shaped carbohydrate that traps bad-tasting molecules. Chocolate, especially sensitive to adulteration, requires its own coating. Those for meats must contain a lubricious wax, called a meat release agent, so that the meat slides right out.

    <h2>Bioremediation</h2>
    <a href="https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Bioremediation#Fungi_.28Mycoremediation.29">Bioremediation wiki</a>
Bacteria are widely diverse organisms, and thus make excellent players in biodegradation and bioremediation. There are few universal toxins to bacteria, so there is likely an organism able to break down any given substrate, when provided with the right conditions (anaerobic versus aerobic environment, sufficient electron donors or acceptors, etc.)

        The Johnston landfill is expected to reach capacity by 2034, according to a recent report published by the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation. Approximately 324,234 tons of Rhode Island’s municipal solid waste went to the Johnston landfill in CY18. According to RIRRC, about 32% – or 103,754.86 tons – of that could have been composted.

        It’s also worth noting that the recycling process creates an inky sludge that presents a disposal challenge. Many common inks contain metals such as chromium, zinc, and lead, which can seep into water supplies.

            Precious Plastic is an open hardware plastic recycling project and is a type of open source digital commons project. The project was started in 2013 by Dave Hakkens and is now in its fourth iteration. It relies on a series of machines and tools which grind, melt, and inject recycled plastic, allowing for the creation of new products out of recycled plastic on a small scale. (wiki)

            Because of BPA, everybody dances around what to call the can’s internal corrosion inhibitor. The FDA calls it a resinous and polymeric coating. At Can School, Ball employees called it an organic coating, or water-based polymer. The EPA calls it a chemical pollutant. Health researchers call it an endocrine disruptor, and a chronic toxin.
